# Next.js 15 Server-Side Rendering Error with Date Object

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js 15 applications. The issue arises when attempting to use browser-specific APIs, such as the `Date` object, within components that are rendered on the server.

## Problem
The `about.js` file contains a component that uses the `Date` object to display the current date and time. When Next.js attempts to render this component on the server, it encounters an error because the `Date` object is not available in the server-side environment in the same way it is in the browser.

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file shows how to correctly handle this issue. We use the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` to fetch the date on the server and then pass it down as a prop to the component. This ensures that the date is properly generated during the server-side rendering process and prevents runtime errors in the browser.
